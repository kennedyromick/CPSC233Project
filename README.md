# ASTROBLAST!
ASTROBLAST! is a single player platform animation side scroller game (gameplay is viewed from a side-view camera angle). The player moves through various platforms, while avoiding objects, to complete an objective. The application asks the user for input on the playerâ€™s move and responds appropriately to that movement, as well as checking if any obstacles have been hit/not overcome. Progression to the next level or failure is determined by time limit or successful passage of all obstacles.

### Instructions
The objective of the game is to complete the level with the fewest collisions possible, and without dying in the harder levels.
##### Controls
Use the keyboard arrows to control motion: "^" jump, ">" forward, "<" backward. The avatar cannot move through obstacles (black blocks), and loses velocity upon collision. 
##### Level One
Avatar cannot die. Non-moving, non-lethal objects only. 
##### Level Two
Player killed instantly by falling into gaps. All other obstacles, collisions and enemies decrease health (3 hearts). Some moving objects; simple, isolated enemies. 
##### Level Three
Limited number of collisions allowed: health decreases with collisions. Enemies and timed attacks present; one hit = loss of one life. Avatar velocity increased.
