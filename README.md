# ASTROBLAST!
ASTROBLAST! is a single player platform animation side scroller game (gameplay is viewed from a side-view camera angle). The player moves through various platforms, while avoiding objects, to complete an objective. The application asks the user for input on the playerâ€™s move and responds appropriately to that movement, as well as checking if any obstacles have been hit/not overcome. Progression to the next level or failure is determined by successful passage of all obstacles to reach the end of the level.

### Instructions
The objective of the game is to complete each level without dying or colliding into any enemies where they are present. Reverse gravity is in effect, so your avatar will move in the direction (up or down) you choose to send it using the up and down arrow keys, and will switch direction according to the keys or stop moving once it hits a platform. For example, if you press the "up" key once, the avatar will continue to float upwards until you change direction or it hits a platform.
##### Controls
Use the keyboard arrows to control motion: ">" right and "<" left. The up and down arrow keys reverse gravity. There is no jump feature, with reverse gravity the avatar is continuously moving upwards or downwards until they collide with a platform.
##### Level One
Player cannot die. No enemies are presented, only black platforms. This level is an opportunity to get use to the movement of the avatar for future levels. To complete the level move right until the vertical wall is hit, this will bring you to level 2.
##### Level Two
Player can now die by colliding into enemies (red). Same movement and objective as level one, however with the addition of avoiding enemies.
##### Level Three
COMING SOON
